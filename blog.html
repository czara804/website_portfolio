                    It’s common knowledge that Google has photographed a huge amount of the planet for its Street View and Google Earth projects. But for the first time, Google has revealed how much of the world it has photographed: 10 million miles of Street View imagery and 36 million square miles of Google Earth imagery, according to a report from CNET.<br>

                    That Google Earth number is particularly impressive: Google says that it now covers 98 percent of the places in the world where people live. And the 10 million miles of Street View imagery puts Google miles ahead of competitors like Apple, which has just started to include similar street-level photography in Apple Maps with the release of iOS 13 this year. But Apple has a long way to go before it catches up to Google’s millions of miles.<br>
                    
                    Of course, it also highlights the scope of Google’s efforts to catalog the entire world neatly in its apps and services. Even if Street View or Google Earth’s satellite images aren’t features you use every day, it’s still a huge part of the Google Maps service. “Imagery is at the core of everything we do,” Ethan Russell, a director of product at Google Maps, commented to CNET. “We think of it as the foundation of the entire mapmaking process.”<br>

                        By allowing this fear of failing and looking stupid consume me, I never asked how a certain piece of code worked or why we implemented a certain solution over another. I spent hours trying to piece together StackOverflow answers and other parts of our codebase to try and make sense of things instead of just asking for help or a pair programming session. These are the questions and learning opportunities that, had I encountered them sooner, would have made me a much better developer in a shorter amount of time. Instead, I spent an exaggerated amount of time learning things superficially rather than fully experiencing and building a solid foundation of core development concepts and best practices. Bummer.<br>
                        So what do we do if all of this failure is inevitable?<br>
                        Embrace it.<br>
                        Don’t be fearful of it. Acknowledge it. Use it as a catapult in your journey, not as a ball and chain that drags you down. This is probably the most important piece of advice every new developer should know and is the reason I listed it first.<br>
                        By experiencing failure at a faster rate, you are inevitably catapulting yourself to the top of the steep learning curve that seems to discourage a lot of people.<br>
                        When you fail fast and fail often, it likely means you are learning things at a significantly faster rate than someone who does their best to avoid failure. The sooner you learn how to deal with merge conflicts, run into console errors while setting up Webpack, or experience what happens when you forget a WHERE clause in your SQL query, the greater your growth as a developer.<br>

                            We started Made with Code because increasingly more aspects in our lives are powered by technology, yet women aren’t represented in the roles that make technology happen.
                            If we can inspire teen girls to see that code can help them pursue their passions, whatever they may be, then hopefully they will begin to contribute their voices to the field of technology for the benefit of us all. <br>

                                    In early November, The Dragon Prince fandom was rocked by allegations from several women that showrunner Aaron Ehasz had created an abusive environment for women on the Netflix animated show and in his previous position at notoriously hostile-to-women video game developer Riot Games. The claims that he ignored, belittled, and gaslit his female employees, leading some of them to quit or be fired, were especially jarring to a community that strongly supports the show and his previous venture, Avatar: The Last Airbender, in part because of their empowering stories about women. Ehasz’s tepid Twitter response hasn’t done much to resolve the conflict. The news has cast a shadow over the show’s third season, which debuts on Netflix on Nov. 22.
                                    While fans may be justified in abandoning the show out of solidarity with the accusers, it would be a tragedy for one man’s actions to undo all the excellent work happening at Wonderstorm, The Dragon Prince’s studio. The show’s writers are continuing to deliver a dramatic, nuanced story featuring a cast of well-developed characters, and stressing ethnic diversity and LGBTQ representation. Ironically, though, many of the characters in season 3 of The Dragon Prince are grappling with the same questions as the show’s fans: How do you respond to wrongdoing by people you love? This season acknowledges that sometimes the healthiest, bravest, and best thing people can do is leave poisonous parts of their lives behind and find better ways to move forward.<br>

                                        From iPhones to microwaves to birth control pills, few of us take the time to consider whether technologies we use in our daily lives are gender neutral or if they are somehow encouraging gender stereotypes. Shivani Gupta of Feminist Approach to Technology (FAT) explains how the various technologies in our world can be tools of liberation or oppression.
                                </p>

                                        Feminist Technology <br>

                                        For women to be able to participate equally, we need technologies that empower women and bridge the digital gender divide. We need feminist technology (because feminism also means equality). While there cannot be only one understanding of the term feminist technology (because there isn’t only one feminism), I can offer the following basic definition of “Feminist Technology” as: “technological innovations that would enhance women’s lives through women’s agenda to make them equal (Layne 2010).”
                                        
                                        Another question that surrounds the idea of feminist technology: is it necessary that technology should be created by a woman with a feminist consciousness? The short answer is that it’s complicated, and not everything is completely black or white. For example, tampons were invented by a man with a sexist attitude towards menstruation, but female contraceptive pills were invented by a man to provide options to women (Layne 2010). Some technologies, such as a pink phone or a jeweled laptop, might be the innovation of a woman, yet do nothing to improve women’s lives or pave a path toward equality. Instead, they end up reinforcing gender stereotypes in a consumer-centric world. Thus, technology needs to be strategically evaluated by examining its impact on the lives of women, regardless of the inventor’s gender.<br>
