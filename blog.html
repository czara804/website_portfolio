                                    In early November, The Dragon Prince fandom was rocked by allegations from several women that showrunner Aaron Ehasz had created an abusive environment for women on the Netflix animated show and in his previous position at notoriously hostile-to-women video game developer Riot Games. The claims that he ignored, belittled, and gaslit his female employees, leading some of them to quit or be fired, were especially jarring to a community that strongly supports the show and his previous venture, Avatar: The Last Airbender, in part because of their empowering stories about women. Ehasz’s tepid Twitter response hasn’t done much to resolve the conflict. The news has cast a shadow over the show’s third season, which debuts on Netflix on Nov. 22.

                                    While fans may be justified in abandoning the show out of solidarity with the accusers, it would be a tragedy for one man’s actions to undo all the excellent work happening at Wonderstorm, The Dragon Prince’s studio. The show’s writers are continuing to deliver a dramatic, nuanced story featuring a cast of well-developed characters, and stressing ethnic diversity and LGBTQ representation. Ironically, though, many of the characters in season 3 of The Dragon Prince are grappling with the same questions as the show’s fans: How do you respond to wrongdoing by people you love? This season acknowledges that sometimes the healthiest, bravest, and best thing people can do is leave poisonous parts of their lives behind and find better ways to move forward.

                    <h2>Is there such a thing as feminist technology?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-photo" id="blog1photo">03 MAY</div>

                                        From iPhones to microwaves to birth control pills, few of us take the time to consider whether technologies we use in our daily lives are gender neutral or if they are somehow encouraging gender stereotypes. Shivani Gupta of Feminist Approach to Technology (FAT) explains how the various technologies in our world can be tools of liberation or oppression.
                                </p>

                                        Feminist Technology <br>

                                        For women to be able to participate equally, we need technologies that empower women and bridge the digital gender divide. We need feminist technology (because feminism also means equality). While there cannot be only one understanding of the term feminist technology (because there isn’t only one feminism), I can offer the following basic definition of “Feminist Technology” as: “technological innovations that would enhance women’s lives through women’s agenda to make them equal (Layne 2010).”
                                        
                                        Another question that surrounds the idea of feminist technology: is it necessary that technology should be created by a woman with a feminist consciousness? The short answer is that it’s complicated, and not everything is completely black or white. For example, tampons were invented by a man with a sexist attitude towards menstruation, but female contraceptive pills were invented by a man to provide options to women (Layne 2010). Some technologies, such as a pink phone or a jeweled laptop, might be the innovation of a woman, yet do nothing to improve women’s lives or pave a path toward equality. Instead, they end up reinforcing gender stereotypes in a consumer-centric world. Thus, technology needs to be strategically evaluated by examining its impact on the lives of women, regardless of the inventor’s gender.
